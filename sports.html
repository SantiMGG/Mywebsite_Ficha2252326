        <p>Downhill is one of the most risky sports in the world and one of the modalities of mountain biking that consists of descending as quickly as possible on a natural track, which has obstacles, which may well be natural or also artificial. The winner is the one who makes the shortest possible time on the timed descent.</p>
        <h2>The beginnings</h2>
        <p>Sport began in the United States in the late 70s, more precisely in the state of California. The motorcyclists did the same downhill test as it is known today, but the use of this vehicle was prohibited due to the damage it caused, which led them to change their motorcycles for bicycles in order to continue experiencing the adrenaline that they so much enjoyed. liked.
        At first, bicycles were not suitable for practicing this sport, since in better conditions you need bicycles with front and rear suspensions with shock absorbers and hydraulic oil, as well as disc brakes, wider tires and chainring or chain guide protectors.</p>
        <h2>Safety first</h2>
        <p>Downhill bikes are very different from conventional bikes because they are much heavier, so there is more speed on the descent. Athletes must carry all protective equipment to avoid injury after a fall.
        The main recommendation to be an outstanding athlete in dowhnill is that the speed during the descent is progressive. It is not convenient to go out at the highest speed, but the ideal is to go step by step to obtain the expected results.
        World record
            
        To practice downhill you have to feel passion and be willing to do anything to win. In time-trial competitions, a downhill athlete can reach a speed of 167 kilometers per hour. This is the world record set by the Austrian Markus St√∂ckl, in a descent in the Atacama desert in Chile.
            
        That is a speed that puts the athlete to the limit of his abilities and that is why the recommendation is to follow instinct and make his body the best tool to avoid falls, because if that does not happen it will be for problems. Above all, you have to be sure of what you are doing, to be confident but responsibly, and not to exceed what you can give.
